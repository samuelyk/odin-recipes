    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Cortados are coffee drinks with Spanish origins; the name, or 
        Spanish word, is actually the past participle of cortar which means 
        “to cut.” Contrary to what you might think, “cut” doesn't refer to 
        any blades, but rather refers to dilution. As in, we're “cutting” 
        the bitterness of our espresso with steamed milk, and perhaps adding 
        a bit of "latte art" while we're at it!</p>

    <p>I first tried a cortado in Spain back in 2013, and have since seen 
        them rise in popularity on cafe menus all over the United States! 
        While living in San Francisco, I remember popping into Blue Bottle 
        Coffee Company and finding their Cortado delightful!</p>
