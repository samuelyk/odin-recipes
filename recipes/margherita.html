    <h1>Pizza Margherita</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>My search for the best homemade margherita pizza 
        (made in a standard oven with everyday ingredients) is over! 
        This classic pizza is made with everyday ingredients and 
        topped with a simple fresh pizza sauce made from canned 
        tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil. You'll want 
        to make it over and over again!</p>

    <p>If you maintain a sourdough starter, I highly recommend 
        preparing this pizza with sourdough pizza dough! It offers 
        a flavor and texture that cannot be replicated.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <h3>Homemade Pizza Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2&frac12; cups (300 g) unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>&frac12; teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>&frac34; teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>7 ounces (105&deg;F to 115&deg;F) warm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>semolina and all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pizza Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup pureed or crushed canned San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>2-3 fresh garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2-3 large pinches of kosher salt</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Toppings:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons finely grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>7 ounces fresh mozzarella chees (not packed in water)</li>
        <li>5-6 large fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare Pizza Dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together 
            the all-purpose flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Add the 
            warm water and olive oil, and stir the mixture with a 
            wooden spoon until the dough just begins to come together. 
            It will seem shaggy and dry, but don't worry.<br><br></li>

        <li>Scrape the dough onto a well-floured counter top and knead 
            the dough for three minutes. It should quickly come together 
            and begin to get sticky. Dust the dough with flour as needed 
            (sometimes I will have to do this 2 to 3 times, depending on 
            humidity levels) - it should be slightly tacky, but should 
            not be sticking to your counter top.  After about 3 minutes, 
            the dough should be smooth, slightly elastic, and tacky. 
            Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil, and 
            place the dough into the bowl.<br><br></li>

        <li>Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel (or plastic wrap) and 
            allow the dough to rise in a warm, dry area of your kitchen 
            for 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size. Proofing 
            Tip: If your kitchen is very cold, heat a large heatproof 
            measuring cup of water in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. 
            This creates a nice warm environment. Remove the cup and place 
            the bowl with the dough in the microwave until it has risen. 
            [If you are preparing the dough in advance, see the note 
            section for freezing instructions.]<br><br></li>

        <li>Preheat Oven and Pizza Steel or Stone: Place the pizza steel 
            (or stone) on the second to top rack of your oven (roughly 8 
            inches from the broiler element), and preheat the oven and 
            steel (or stone) to 550°F (285°C) for a minumum of 1 hour. 
            If your oven does not go up to 550°F (285°C) or you are using
             a delicate pizza stone, I recommend heating it to a maximum 
             of 500°F (260°C)<br><br></li>

        <li>As the oven is preheating, assemble the ingredients. 
            In a small bowl, stir together the pureed tomatoes, 
            minced garlic, extra virgin olive oil, pepper, and salt. 
            Set aside another small bowl with the cubed mozzarella 
            cheese (pat the cheese with a paper towel to remove any 
            excess moisture). Set aside the basil leaves and grated 
            parmigiano-reggiano cheese for easy grabbing.<br><br></li>

        <li>Separate the dough into two equal-sized portions. It will 
            deflate slightly, but that is OK. Place the dough on a large 
            plate or floured counter top, cover gently with plastic wrap, 
            and allow the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.<br><br></li>

        <li>Assemble the Pizza: Sprinkle the pizza peel (if you do not
             own a pizza peel, you can try using the back of a half 
             sheet pan - but it is tricky!) with a tablespoon of semolina 
             and dusting of all-purpose flour. Gently use both hands 
             to stretch one ball of pizza dough into roughly a 10-inch 
             circle (don't worry if its not perfectly uniform). If the 
             dough springs back or is too elastic, allow it to rest for 
             an additional five minutes. The edges of the dough can be 
             slightly thicker, but make sure the center of the dough is 
             thin (you should be able to see some light through it if 
             you held it up). Gently transfer the dough onto the semolina
              and flour dusted pizza peel or baking sheet.<br><br></li>

        <li>Drizzle or brush the dough lightly (using your fingertips) 
            with olive oil (roughly a teaspoon). Using a large spoon, 
            add roughly ½ cup of the tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, 
            leaving a ½-inch or ¾-inch border on all sides. Use the back 
            of the spoon to spread it evenly and thinly. Sprinkle a 
            tablespoon of parmigiano-reggiano cheese onto the pizza sauce. 
            Add half of the cubed mozzarella, distributing it evenly over 
            the entire pizza. Using your hands, tear a few large basil 
            leaves, and sprinkle the basil over the pizza. At this point, 
            I'll occasionally stretch the sides of the dough out a bit 
            to make it even thinner. Gently slide the pizza from the peel 
            onto the heated baking stone. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or 
            until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and 
            caramelized and the edges of the pizza are golden brown. 
            Note: If you're looking for more color, finish the pizza 
            under the low or medium broil setting, but watch it carefully!
            <br>
            <br>Remove the pizza carefully from the oven with the pizza peel, 
            transfer to a wooden cutting board or foil, drizzle the top with 
            olive oil, some grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, and chiffonade 
            of fresh basil. Slice and serve immediately and/or prepare the 
            second pizza.<br><br></li>

        <li>Serving Tip: If you're serving two pizzas at once, I recommend 
            placing the cooked pizza on a separate baking sheet while you 
            prepare the other pizza. In the last few minutes of cooking, 
            place the prepared pizza into the oven (on a rack below the 
            pizza stone) so that it is extra hot for serving. Otherwise, I 
            recommend serving one pizza fresh out of the oven, keeping the 
            oven hot, and preparing the second pizza after people have gone 
            through the first one! The pizza will taste great either way, 
            but it is at its prime within minutes out of the oven!</li>
