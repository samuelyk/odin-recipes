    <h1>Broccoli Cheddar Soup</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Broccoli cheddar soup is one of Jack's favorite foods. Ask him 
        about the version at Panera Bread, and he'll go on and on about 
        its creamy texture and rich, tangy, cheesy flavor. He never expected 
        me to develop a broccoli cheddar soup recipe at home (unless you 
        count this vegan twist), but with the holidays right around the 
        corner, I thought it would be fun to surprise him with one.</p>

    <p>So, on a gray, chilly day last weekend, when we were both craving 
        comfort food, I finally made him this broccoli cheddar soup recipe. 
        As we sat down with our steaming bowls, I waited anxiously to see 
        what he'd think. I shouldn't have worried. He took one taste and 
        declared, “This recipe is even better than Panera's broccoli cheddar 
        soup!” A few minutes later, he was already heading back for seconds. 
        I hope you love this recipe too!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk or unsweetened almond milk</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>3 cups chopped broccoli florets</li>
        <li>1 large carrot, julienned or finely chopped</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded cheddar cheese, about 2 heaping cups</li>
        <li>Homemade croutons, for serving, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. 
            Add the onion, salt, and several grinds of pepper and cook, 
            stirring, for 5 minutes, or until softened. Stir in the garlic 
            and cook for another minute, then sprinkle in the flour and whisk 
            continuously for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the flour turns golden. 
            Slowly pour in the milk, whisking continuously.</li>

        <br><li>Add the broth, broccoli, carrot, and mustard and stir to 
            combine. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the broccoli 
            is tender.</li>

        <br><li>Gradually add the cheese, stirring after each addition, until 
            all the cheese is melted and the soup is creamy. Season to 
            taste and serve with croutons, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
